### Dudley's Fundraiser Elevator Speech
"Hi, I just wanted to let you know my Robotics group Option 16 is holding a fundraiser with Dudley's bakery, and I was wondering if you would be interested in ordering something there. Our fundraiser allows you to order online any bread, pies, or other baked goods Dudley's has to offer. These fundraisers helps our team host outreach and mentoring programs, and this one is currently the biggest fundraiser our team has this year. The order and payment is due on November 1st, and our team will get all the orders shipped to Westview to be picked up. All orders will be picked up on November 15th, and I will be able to bring it directly to you."
I asked:
