# Preseason Digital Notebook Example
Name: Melody Sackman

Section: I2RC

Week: 5


## Code

The main topic this week was: DriveTrain and Encoders Lab

Commands: EncoderDrive.java

Subsystems: DriveTrain.java 

### How does the code work?
Write about how it works here

The code in EncoderDrive.java initializes and tracks the speed of the robot. It also stops the robots movement with the "end" method and checks if it is finished moving as well. EncoderDrive.java can be used to drive the robot at a set distance and speed. DriveTrain.java is meant to create the left and right driveTalons.The subsystem is also used to measure (or get/set) and reset values such as angles. 


### Important notes for future reference
Notes about git, and helpful resources, etc. 
Please put them here, they will really help you in the future 
    - In WIPLib/VS Code, Build Robot Code is similar to compiling and will
      check if the code works or not
    - Whenever you commit in git desktop, you have to leave a short description 
      of your progress
    - To push in git desktop, you have to click publish and fetch origin at 
      the top
